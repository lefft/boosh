Job  
VERSE:1  In the land of Uz there lived a man  whose name was Job. This man was  blameless and upright; he feared God  and shunned evil.  
VERSE:2 He had seven sons and three  daughters,  
VERSE:3 and he owned seven thousand sheep,  three thousand camels, five hundred  yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys,  and had a large number of servants. He  was the greatest man among all the  people of the East.  
VERSE:4 His sons used to take turns holding  feasts in their homes, and they would  invite their three sisters to eat and drink  with them.  
VERSE:5 When a period of feasting had run its  course, Job would send and have them  purified. Early in the morning he would  sacrifice a burnt offering for each of  them, thinking, "Perhaps my children  have sinned and cursed God in their  hearts." This was Job's regular custom.  
VERSE:6 One day the angels came to present  themselves before the Lord , and Satan  also came with them.  
VERSE:7 The Lord said to Satan, "Where have  you come from?" Satan answered the  Lord , "From roaming through the earth  and going back and forth in it."  Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you  considered my servant Job? There is no  one on earth like him; he is blameless  and upright, a man who fears God and  shuns evil."  
VERSE:9 "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan  replied.  
VERSE:10 "Have you not put a hedge around him  and his household and everything he  has? You have blessed the work of his  hands, so that his flocks and herds are  spread throughout the land.  
VERSE:11 But stretch out your hand and strike  everything he has, and he will surely  curse you to your face."  
VERSE:12 The Lord said to Satan, "Very well,  then, everything he has is in your hands,  but on the man himself do not lay a  finger." Then Satan went out from the  presence of the Lord .  
VERSE:13 One day when Job's sons and  daughters were feasting and drinking  wine at the oldest brother's house,  
VERSE:14 a messenger came to Job and said,  "The oxen were plowing and the  donkeys were grazing nearby,  
VERSE:15 and the Sabeans attacked and carried  them off. They put the servants to the  sword, and I am the only one who has  escaped to tell you!"  
VERSE:16 While he was still speaking, another  messenger came and said, "The fire of  God fell from the sky and burned up the  sheep and the servants, and I am the  only one who has escaped to tell you!"  
VERSE:17 While he was still speaking, another  messenger came and said, "The  Chaldeans formed three raiding parties  and swept down on your camels and  carried them off. They put the servants  to the sword, and I am the only one who  has escaped to tell you!"  
VERSE:18 While he was still speaking, yet  another messenger came and said,  "Your sons and daughters were feasting  and drinking wine at the oldest brother's  house,  
VERSE:19 when suddenly a mighty wind swept in  from the desert and struck the four  corners of the house. It collapsed on  them and they are dead, and I am the  only one who has escaped to tell you!"  
VERSE:20 At this, Job got up and tore his robe  and shaved his head. Then he fell to the  ground in worship  
VERSE:21 and said: "Naked I came from my  mother's womb, and naked I will depart.  The Lord gave and the Lord has taken  away; may the name of the Lord be  praised."  
VERSE:22 ln all this, Job did not sin by charging  God with wrongdoing.  And the Lord said to Satan, "Where  have you come from?" Satan answered  the Lord , "From roaming through the  earth and going back and forth in it."  
VERSE:3 Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you  considered my servant Job? There is no  one on earth like him; he is blameless  and upright, a man who fears God and  shuns evil. And he still maintains his  integrity, though you incited me against  him to ruin him without any reason."  
VERSE:4 "Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man  will give all he has for his own life.  
VERSE:5 But stretch out your hand and strike his  flesh and bones, and he will surely  curse you to your face."  
VERSE:6 The Lord said to Satan, "Very well, then,  he is in your hands; but you must spare  his life."  
VERSE:7 So Satan went out from the presence of  the Lord and afflicted Job with painful  sores from the soles of his feet to the  top of his head.  
VERSE:8 Then Job took a piece of broken pottery  and scraped himself with it as he sat  among the ashes.  
VERSE:9 His wife said to him, "Are you still  holding on to your integrity? Curse God  and die!"  fcOn another day the angels came to  present themselves before the Lord ,  and Satan also came with them to  present himself before him.  
VERSE:10 He replied, "You are talking like a  foolish woman. Shall we accept good  from God, and not trouble?" In all this,  Job did not sin in what he said.  When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the  Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and  Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all  the troubles that had come upon him,  they set out from their homes and met  together by agreement to go and  sympathize with him and comfort him.  
VERSE:12 When they saw him from a distance,  they could hardly recognize him; they  began to weep aloud, and they tore their  robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.  
VERSE:13 Then they sat on the ground with him  for seven days and seven nights. No  one said a word to him, because they  saw how great his suffering was.  May those who curse days curse that  day, those who are ready to rouse  Leviathan.  
VERSE:9 May its morning stars become dark;  may it wait for daylight in vain and not  see the first rays of dawn,  
VERSE:10 for it did not shut the doors of the  womb on me to hide trouble from my  eyes.  ""Why did I not perish at birth, and die  as I came from the womb?  
VERSE:12 Why were there knees to receive me  and breasts that I might be nursed?  OAfter this, Job opened his mouth and  cursed the day of his birth.  
VERSE:2 He said:  
VERSE:3 "May the day of my birth perish, and  the night it was said, 'A boy is born!'  
VERSE:4 That day-may it turn to darkness; may  God above not care about it; may no  light shine upon it.  
VERSE:5 May darkness and deep shadow claim  it once more; may a cloud settle over it;  may blackness overwhelm its light.  For now I would be lying down in  peace; I would be asleep and at rest  
VERSE:14 with kings and counselors of the earth,  who built for themselves places now  lying in ruins,  
VERSE:15 with rulers who had gold, who filled  their houses with silver.  
VERSE:16 Or why was I not hidden in the ground  like a stillborn child, like an infant who  never saw the light of day?  
VERSE:17 There the wicked cease from turmoil,  and there the weary are at rest.  That night-may thick darkness seize it;  may it not be included among the days  of the year nor be entered in any of the  months.  
VERSE:7 May that night be barren; may no shout  of joy be heard in it.  Captives also enjoy their ease; they no  longer hear the slave driver's shout.  : &gt;  The small and the great are there, and  the slave is freed from his master.  
VERSE:20 "Why is light given to those in misery,  and life to the bitter of soul,  
VERSE:21 to those who long for death that does  not come, who search for it more than  for hidden treasure,  
VERSE:22 who are filled with gladness and  rejoice when they reach the grave?  
VERSE:23 Why is life given to a man whose way  is hidden, whom God has hedged in?  
VERSE:24 For sighing comes to me instead of  food; my groans pour out like water.  
VERSE:25 What I feared has come upon me;  what I dreaded has happened to me.  
VERSE:26 l have no peace, no quietness; I have  no rest, but only turmoil."  tThen Eliphaz the Temanite replied:  
VERSE:2 "lf someone ventures a word with you,  will you be impatient? But who can keep  from speaking?  
VERSE:3 Think how you have instructed many,  how you have strengthened feeble  hands.  
VERSE:4 Your words have supported those who  stumbled; you have strengthened  faltering knees.  
VERSE:5 But now trouble comes to you, and you  are discouraged; it strikes you, and you  are dismayed.  
VERSE:6 Should not your piety be your  confidence and your blameless ways  your hope?  
VERSE:7 "Consider now: Who, being innocent,  has ever perished? Where were the  upright ever destroyed?  
VERSE:8 As I have observed, those who plow  evil and those who sow trouble reap it.  
VERSE:9 At the breath of God they are  destroyed; at the blast of his anger they  perish.  
VERSE:10 The lions may roar and growl, yet the  teeth of the great lions are broken.  
VERSE:11 The lion perishes for lack of prey, and  the cubs of the lioness are scattered.  
VERSE:12 "A word was secretly brought to me,  my ears caught a whisper of it.  
VERSE:13 Amid disquieting dreams in the night,  when deep sleep falls on men,  
VERSE:14 fear and trembling seized me and  made all my bones shake.  
VERSE:15 A spirit glided past my face, and the  hair on my body stood on end.  
VERSE:16 lt stopped, but I could not tell what it  was. A form stood before my eyes, and I  heard a hushed voice:  
VERSE:17 'Can a mortal be more righteous than  God? Can a man be more pure than his  Maker?  
VERSE:18 lf God places no trust in his servants, if  he charges his angels with error,  
VERSE:19 how much more those who live in  houses of clay, whose foundations are  in the dust, who are crushed more  readily than a moth!  
VERSE:20 Between dawn and dusk they are  broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish  forever.  
VERSE:21 Are not the cords of their tent pulled up,  so that they die without wisdom?'  ^"Call if you will, but who will answer  you? To which of the holy ones will you  turn?  
VERSE:2 Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays  the simple.  
VERSE:3 I myself have seen a fool taking root,  but suddenly his house was cursed.  
VERSE:4 His children are far from safety,  crushed in court without a defender.  
VERSE:5 The hungry consume his harvest,  taking it even from among thorns, and  the thirsty pant after his wealth.  
VERSE:6 For hardship does not spring from the  soil, nor does trouble sprout from the  ground.  
VERSE:7 Yet man is born to trouble as surely as  sparks fly upward.  
VERSE:8 "But if it were I, I would appeal to God; I  would lay my cause before him.  He performs wonders that cannot be  fathomed, miracles that cannot be  counted.  He bestows rain on the earth;  sends water upon the countryside.  he  
VERSE:11 The lowly he sets on high, and those  who mourn are lifted to safety.  
VERSE:12 He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so  that their hands achieve no success.  
VERSE:13 He catches the wise in their craftiness,  and the schemes of the wily are swept  away.  
VERSE:14 Darkness comes upon them in the  daytime; at noon they grope as in the  night.  
VERSE:15 He saves the needy from the sword in  their mouth; he saves them from the  clutches of the powerful.  
VERSE:16 So the poor have hope, and injustice
