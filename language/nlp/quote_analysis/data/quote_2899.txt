I think that much of the advice given to young men about saving money is wrong.  I never saved a cent until I was forty years old.  I invested in myself - in study, in mastering my tools, in preparation.  Many a man who is putting a few dollars a week into the bank would do much better to put it into himself. by Henry Ford
