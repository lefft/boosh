database of quotes, at 
  https://www.quotedb.com

example quote url: 
  https://www.quotedb.com/quotes/4085

a few fields that should have the quote text, e.g.: 
  <title>Ignorance is preferable to error...</title>
  <meta name="Keywords" content="Ignorance is preferable to error...">
  <meta name="Description" content="Ignorance is preferable to error...">

there is also a field w a rating: 
  alt="3.55 avg (11 votes)"

there is also a field w "category" (https://www.quotedb.com/categories): 
  Listed in: <a href="/categories/miscellaneous"...


want to scrape the quotes and get them into a df

strategy: 
  - determine which url's are valid, and create a shell df w url column
  - fill the author, year, and text fields of the df with info from the page
  - done

implementation: 
  - scrape:
      >> try every four-digit num as a url (hope we dont get rate limited! :o)
      >> for valid ones, download the page into a local folder
  
  - construct dataset: 
      >> now read in each page from local folder
      >> extract quote from <title> tag
      >> strip off author and year
      >> put author and year into their respective cells
      >> put text into its respective cell

  - analyze data: 
      >> basic summary stats
      >> author distribution
      >> year distribution
      >> mlu/nchar analysis
      >> rating analysis
      >> tf-idf, by decade and author etc.
      >> ...

  - write up results, put on website, <333 !
