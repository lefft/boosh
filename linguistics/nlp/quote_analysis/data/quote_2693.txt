I think it's insulting to people who have a heritage of slavery to compare the homosexual experience in America to that. It's an unfortunate, cheap attempt to piggyback on something and to co-opt life experiences of others, claim that you've experienced them yourselves so that you can advance a cause. by Rush Limbaugh
