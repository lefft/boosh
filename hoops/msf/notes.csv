dat <-  
  query_msf_api(url, write=FALSE, flatten=TRUE)$gameplaybyplay$plays$play %>%

# the values of 'variable' can be uncollapsed by splitting on "."
# there are 7 play types, each w structure listed below

# we want to remove all redundant info -- 
# mostly this comes in the form of player-level info.
# where 
# 			* in {shooting, assisting, blocking, drawnBy, penalized, 
#							away, home, retrieving, incoming, outgoing, lostBy, stolenBy}, 
# 
# we have the following five attributes:

*Player:
	1. FirstName
	2. ID
	3. JerseyNumber
	4. LastName
	5. Position

we can just toss all player-rows that aren't ID, and then use a lookup table 
to swap out player id's for names if/when we want to do that.
