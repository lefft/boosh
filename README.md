### sandboxxxe ~~ <(o_0)^ 

this repo is a sandbox for fiddling around, sketching out ideas, learning/practicing new techniques, etc.

[also here's this](http://lefft.xyz/img/bron-gif-final.gif)

<br>

##### main stuff in here, of jun/2017:


> `arithmetic_from_scratch/` 
	answering the question: "how does/can a calculator 'work'," in the sense i've always had in mind. rules are: just base functions; no arithmetic operators; we're allowed to use `identical()` for equality but only container-related stuff otherwise(?); (shd we allow calls to `length()`?!)


<br>

> `fiddle_bayes/`
	play around with various techniques for bayesian inference + estimation with stan and pymc 

<br>

> `fiddle_monadz/` 
	haskell sub-sandbox + area to investigate/build monadic structures in R, + to practice useful FP techniques in general. also s/o to [this v nice blog post](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2016/08/the-magrittr-monad/) + [s/o this guy too](http://randomlydistributedthoughts.blogspot.com/2014/06/using-writer-monads-in-r.html).

<br>

> `fiddle_py/` 
	python sub-sandboxxxe

<br>

> `fiddle_r/`
	R sub-sandboxxxe

<br>


> `fiddle_web/` 
	web dev sub-sandbox


<br>


> `hoops/`
	mess around with nba data; and/or use nba data as vehicle for practicing other stuff e.g. `hoops/lebron_gif/` for playing with imagemagick via plugins for R (`magick::`) and python (`Wand`/`MagickWand`); also shouts to [animation domination high-def](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAufyxBD-tI) (relevant bit around 0:38)

<br>

> `oneoffs/` 
	stuff that's not mature enough to get its own dir (yet or ever, depending)
