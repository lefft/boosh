### sandboxxxe ~~ <(o_0)^ 

this repo is a sandbox for fiddling around, sketching out ideas, learning new technique, practice, etc.

<br>

##### stuff in here, of apr/2017:

> `arithmetic_from_scratch/` 
	answer the question "how does/can a calculator 'work'," in the sense i have in mind 

<br>

> `bates_lme4/`
	to read/work thru -- book chapters from bates (2010), includes theory and code examples (using `lme4::`). seems to be two diff books(?), some chaps in rnw source, others just pdf

<br>

> `bronbron_giffie/` 
	play around w imagemagick via plugins for R (`magick::`) and python (`Wand`/`MagickWand`); make lebron gif from awesome vid by [animation domination high-def](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAufyxBD-tI) (relevant bit around 0:38)

<br>

> `fdr_posthoc_exclusion_sim/`
	copy of chemla blog post on flexible outlier exclusion criteria in RT studies, discuss whether this is a real problem. ultimately will apply this strategy to cases w messy data, unbalanced designs, etc. (note that `ml_fiddling/haus_price/FDR_simstudy.ipynb` is a similar lil sim abt fdr + multiple comparisons) 

<br>


> `ml_fiddling/` 
	practice numpy/pandas data structures + mess around w some scikit-learn models; side-by-side examples in R where useful; also will translate `parser.py` to 3.x as an exercise/bc it would be useful

<br>

> `monad_fp/` 
	explore monadic structures, incl. magrittr `%>%` pipe (s/o to [this v nice blog post](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2016/08/the-magrittr-monad/) + [s/o this guy too](http://randomlydistributedthoughts.blogspot.com/2014/06/using-writer-monads-in-r.html)). also for playing w fp concepts more generally

<br>

> `web_dev/` 
	practice web development (ugh :/). mite want to use nikola for site rebuild (static site generator, built w python 3.x)

> `oneoffs.r` 
	scratchpads for thoughts/ideas to maybe think/write abt in future


...
<br>


##### linxxxe to not forget

> bayesian linear regression w `pyMC`: [v nice blog post](https://dsaber.com/2014/05/28/bayesian-regression-with-pymc-a-brief-tutorial/)

<br>

> mixed effects logistic regression w `pyMC`: [same dude, also v nice](https://dsaber.com/2016/08/27/analyze-your-experiment-with-a-multilevel-logistic-regression-using-pymc3/) (note: previous post sufficient background for this one)

<br>

> `webPPL` textbook to work thru/see if necessary to work thru: [here](https://probmods.org/chapters/02-generative-models.html)

<br>

> [ppl intro](https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/probabilistic-programming-intro)
