<br>

> `fdr_posthoc_exclusion_sim/`
	copy of chemla blog post on flexible outlier exclusion criteria in RT studies, discuss whether this is a real problem. ultimately will apply this strategy to cases w messy data, unbalanced designs, etc. (note that `ml_fiddling/haus_price/FDR_simstudy.ipynb` is a similar lil sim abt fdr + multiple comparisons) 

<br>


> `ml_fiddling/` 
	practice numpy/pandas data structures + mess around w some scikit-learn models; side-by-side examples in R where useful; also will translate `parser.py` to 3.x as an exercise/bc it would be useful

<br>

	explore monadic structures, incl. magrittr `%>%` pipe (s/o to [this v nice blog post](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2016/08/the-magrittr-monad/) + [s/o this guy too](http://randomlydistributedthoughts.blogspot.com/2014/06/using-writer-monads-in-r.html)). also for playing w fp concepts more generally
