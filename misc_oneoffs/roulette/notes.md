- weird, watching vids + came across [this guttag MIT ocw lecture on MC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgO1gpXSUzU), at ~11min, includes discussion of simulating roulette!

- lolol came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVjdXL9xUQw), also simulation based but more concerned w the wheel. seems like very questionable quantitative logic, maybe write a blog post debunking the very idea of making such conclusions when there is 38 possible outcomes and only a few thousand trials!
